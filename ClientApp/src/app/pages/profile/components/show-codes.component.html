    <h2>What are recovery codes?</h2>
    <p>Recovery codes are unique, one-use codes generated as part of the 2-Step Verification process. In the event you lose access to the device you have set 2-Step-Verification on, you can use one of your recovery codes in place of a code generated by the authenticator app to access your account.</p>
    <h2>How to store recovery codes?</h2>
    <p>
        Recovery codes will only display once during the process of enabling 2-Step Verification.
        Therefore you can take a screenshot of the codes and store them in a safe location.
        But we strongly recommend storing your recovery codes someplace other than the device you have activated 2-Step-Verification on to allow for easier account recovery should you lose access to that device.
